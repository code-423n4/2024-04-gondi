If the owner of the pool or PoolUnderwriter are compromised, then pools could be drained by setting underwriting terms against worthless NFTs.
The security of those wallets is in a separate layer (multi-sig / governor contract) and should not be considered.

# Overview

Gondi is a decentralized non-custodial NFT lending protocol that offers the most flexible and capital efficient primitive.  
Gondi loans allows borrowers to access liquidity and obtain the best marginal rate when available as well as allow lenders to earn yield on their capital with the flexibility of entering and exiting their position any moment without affecting borrowers' loans.
Gondi V3 loan offers are submitted from both protocol pools as well as peers market participants creating deep liquidity as well as precise risk pricing..

# Additional context

## Main invariants

- While a loan is outstanding, MultiSourceLoan must own the collateral.

## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)

Security of collateral in MultiSourceLoan.
Pool accounting and potential exploits.

## All trusted roles in the protocol

Owner of Pool (this will be a Governor contract) will update the PoolUnderwriter/base rate strategy.

| Role                                | Description                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Owner of Pool                          | This will be a Governor contract that will update the PoolUnderwriter/base rate strategy.               |
